# ShadowTube

ShadowTube does not relay personal data of any kind, nor does it have the ability to. Individual verification is firmly encouraged. In theory, it should not be able to be blacklisted, as scraping is done with constantly rotating IPs. The Tor service must be running as a background process for this script to execute successfully, meaning users are required to have Tor Browser installed. For the time being, this program is strictly bash, but a website is undergoing development.

Analyzation features are as follows:

* Specific video links
* Complete comment history

### Bash

Install dependencies by running:

    sudo chmod a+x main.py
    ./main.py

ShadowTube does not or relay personal data of any kind, nor does it have the ability to. In regards to the comment analyzation portion, parsing/storing data of any kind is ephemeral. Individual verification is firmly encouraged.
