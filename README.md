# ShadowTube
YouTube shadowban detection. This script does not utilize the YouTube API, or Google dependencies of any kind. In theory, it should not be able to be blacklisted, as scraping is done with constantly rotating IPs via Tor.

Install dependencies by running:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
