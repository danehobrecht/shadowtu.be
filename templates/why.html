		<h3>What is shadowbanning?</h3>
		<p>Shadowbanning, otherwise known as "stealth banning", or, "ghost banning", is the uncommunicated partial or complete removal of content from an online community. The type of effected content varies by service.</p>
		<h3>What incentivizes a platform to shadowban in the first place?</h3>
		<p>If content goes against a platform's poltical, social, or financial agenda, it becomes subject to shadowbanning. There are cases of shadowbanning that base on unknown automated standards.</p>
		<h3>What can be done?</h3>
		<p>Awareness is key. If enough attention is brought to an instance of shadowbanning, it could threaten the platform in differing ways, to which actions are sometimes reversed. Usually a creator seeks evidence by consulting audiences on alternative platforms. Considering said creator might post similarly challenging content on other platforms with their own secretive banning, this is a problematic approach. Uncompromised evidence is crucial, and this website serves to fill the need; to work towards algorithmic equity.</p>
